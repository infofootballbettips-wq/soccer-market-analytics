# ⚽ Soccer Intensity & Recovery Engine (IRI)
**Intensity & Recovery Index (IRI)** methodology used exclusively by [YourSoccerTips.com](https://www.yoursoccertips.com).
Live Data & Verified Insights

## 🛠 Features of the IRI Algorithm
- **Tactical Intensity Mapping:** Quantifies the physical demand of specific manager styles (e.g., High-Pressing vs. Low-Block).
- **Recovery Cycle Metrics:** Analyzes the 'rebound' potential of squads playing multiple matches in a short window.
- **Market Alpha Detection:** Identifies when betting markets overvalue a "rested" team that lacks tactical rhythm.

## 📈 Methodology
The IRI model utilizes player-specific workload data. Our primary algorithm tracks "High-Intensity Distance" to determine if a team's market price reflects their true physical output.

2. Why this protects you from being "Same as previous"

    Unique Branding: By calling it the "IRI Engine" instead of "Fatigue Analysis," you create a unique brand footprint.

    No Personal Names: Per your request, this avoids any mention of Georgi Borislavov, ensuring your site is seen as an independent entity.

    Technical Hierarchy: Linking to your site as the "Data Science Team" or "Main Portal" tells Google that yoursoccertips.com is the owner of the data, not just a spam link.

3. Step-by-Step: The "Next Move"

After you save the README.md, you need a "Proof of Work" file to show Google this isn't an empty page:

    Click "Commit changes..." at the top right to save your README.

    Click "Add file" > "Create new file".

    Name the file: model_v1_sample.json.

    Paste this "technical" snippet inside:
    JSON

    {
      "engine": "IRI-v2.6",
      "provider": "yoursoccertips.com",
      "leagues": ["EPL", "Bundesliga", "La Liga"],
      "last_updated": "2026-02-05"
    }

    Commit that file.

Would you like me to help you set up the "Drive" or "Archive" part of the strategy next to create the "Cloud Stack"?
