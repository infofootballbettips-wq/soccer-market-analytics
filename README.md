* **Public Archive & DOI:** [https://osf.io/65yf3/](https://osf.io/65yf3/)

## 📊 Methodology (The 10-Rule Framework)
Our methodology focuses on identifying statistical deviations in high-liquidity markets by neutralizing emotional variables.
1. **Liquidity Thresholds:** Filters markets with insufficient volume to ensure data stability.
2. **Variance Auditing:** Tracking team performance against market expectations over a 16-year window.
3. **CLV Tracking:** Real-time comparison of opening vs. closing price efficiency.
